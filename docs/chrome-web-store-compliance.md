## Chrome Web Store Compliance Form

To help your extension comply with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies, you'll need to provide the information requested below. The information you enter on this form will be shared with the Chrome Web Store team. Please ensure it's accurate to expedite the review process and reduce the risk of your extension being rejected.

### Single Objective
*An extension should have a single purpose that is both specific and easy to understand.*

**Description of the single objective:**
This Chrome extension enables developers to intercept, mock, and override HTTP API requests directly within their browser for testing and debugging purposes. The extension provides an interface for creating rules that modify API responses in real-time, allowing developers to test application behavior without modifying backend services. Users can create override rules through the extension's options page.
