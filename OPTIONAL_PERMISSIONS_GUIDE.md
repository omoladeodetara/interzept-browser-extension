## 🔐 Optional Host Permissions Explained

### What This Means for Users

With the updated `optional_host_permissions` approach, here's exactly what happens:

## 📱 **Installation Experience**

### **Before (Required Permissions):**
```
⚠️ SCARY WARNING:
"Interzept can read and change all your data on all websites"
"Interzept can access your tabs"

[Install] [Cancel]
```
- Many users get scared and don't install
- Extension works immediately after install

### **After (Optional Permissions):**
```
✅ MINIMAL WARNING:
"Interzept wants to store data locally"
"Interzept wants to intercept network requests"

[Install] [Cancel]
```
- Users feel safer installing
- Extension needs additional setup step

## 🎯 **How Permission Granting Works**

### **Step 1: Initial Install**
- Extension installs with minimal permissions
- No access to any websites yet
- User sees "Grant Permissions" button in options

### **Step 2: User Grants Permissions**
- User clicks "Grant Permissions" button
- Chrome shows permission prompt:
  ```
  "Interzept wants to:
   - Read and change all your data on all websites"
   
  [Allow] [Deny]
  ```

### **Step 3: Extension Activates**
- If allowed: Green status "✅ Host permissions granted"
- If denied: Warning "⚠️ Host permissions required"
- User can try again anytime

## 🔄 **Permission States**

| State | UI Indicator | Functionality |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Checking** | 🔄 "Checking permissions..." | Loading state |
| **Granted** | ✅ Green "permissions granted" | Full functionality |
| **Denied** | ⚠️ Amber "permissions required" | No interception |

## 🛡️ **Security Benefits**

1. **User Control**: Users explicitly choose when to grant broad permissions
2. **Transparency**: Clear indication of what permissions are active
3. **Revokable**: Users can revoke permissions in Chrome settings anytime
4. **Minimal Surface**: Extension starts with least required permissions

## 🎮 **Testing the Flow**

### **Test Scenario 1: Fresh Install**
1. Load extension in Chrome
2. See minimal permission warnings during install
3. Open options page
4. See amber "Grant Permissions" button
5. Click button → Chrome permission prompt
6. Allow → Green status + full functionality

### **Test Scenario 2: Permission Denial**
1. Follow steps 1-5 above
2. Deny → Extension shows warning
3. Rules still save but don't intercept requests
4. User can click "Grant Permissions" again anytime

### **Test Scenario 3: Permission Revocation**
1. Grant permissions (green status)
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click "Details" on Interzept
4. Turn off "Allow on all sites"
5. Return to options → Shows amber warning again

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

The extension now:
- **Checks permissions** on startup using `chrome.permissions.contains()`
- **Requests permissions** when needed using `chrome.permissions.request()`
- **Updates UI dynamically** based on permission status
- **Gracefully handles denial** by disabling interception features

This approach balances **user trust** with **functionality** - users feel safe installing, then grant broader permissions only when they understand the value.
